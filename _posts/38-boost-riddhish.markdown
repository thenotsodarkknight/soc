Boosting is a well known machine learning technique, we use simple weak classifiers in cascade fashion to form a strong classifier. It's extremely effective, facebook uses some version of this algorithm for detecting faces (99.9% accurate). Implement basic adaboost on simulated data, then for digit recognition.

<!--break-->

Again implementation in python using opencv and must follow blockwise execution and tutorial format.

### Week 0
 * Read up on the Adaboost algorithm.
 * Study mathematical theory.
 * Start implementation of basic Adaboost algorithm in Python.

### Week 1
 * Finish code for Adaboost in Python.
 * Vectorise the code using numpy. Speed up of about 10x.
 * Read up on digit recognition via Adaboost.
 * Begin writing code for digit recognition.
 * Write Ipython notebook for Adaboost.

### Week 2
* Acquire training and testing data(images and labels).
* Complete digit classification code.
* Test the digit classifier on data.
* Debug and optimise output and successfully implement the digit classifier.
* Add digit classification to the Ipython notebook.

The project was completed in a little less than three weeks.
