Texter takes a piece of boring text, mostly educational and inserts relevant images in between to make the reading interesting.

<!--break-->

Texter is something my team developed for the Microsoft Code Fun Do hackathon. Texter takes a piece of boring text, mostly educational and inserts relevant images in between to make the reading interesting. This project serves as an educational aid to the illiterate. There are three deliverables:

<!--break-->

1 | Chrome Extension: | which when activated scans the current webpage for all the texts and downloads all the relevant pictures and display it.
2 | Android App: | The app takes some text as input and inserts relevant images in between that text.
3 | Python Script: | This python script compiles the text, images, downloads audio and compiles it into a video. 

The main aim of this Seasons Of Code project would be to analyse the images the API sends and check if those images have text. This images serves as an aid to illiterate, so it wouldn't make any sense if those images have text. So a model needs to be developed which checks for texts in these images and rejects them.
