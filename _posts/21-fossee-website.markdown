3. Optimize web applications to maximize speed and scale. Support diverse clients from high powered desktop computers to small footprint mobile devices.
4. Write client-side code for web-based applications, create fast, easy-to- use, high volume production applications, and develop prototypes quickly.
5. Create and edit PNG and JPEG images and/or take a PSD and turn it into a working website.
6. Write HTML and CSS from scratch.

### Week 1
* Learnt Bootstrap

* Fixed some minor errors like missing images, padding issues etc.

### Week 2
* Learnt git
* Learnt Ajax for fetching data faster on the website (Vidhan: Although I didn't learn ajax in week0, but I guess it would've taken much lesser time to fetch data dynamically if I did.)

### Week 3
* Setup a textbox, to load example-code and execute it.
* Currently fixing navbar errors - Chapters and Books donâ€™t load in same panel.
