An online system for delivery of (food, and other things) items within the institute. The project will include development of an app/web interface for vendors as well as students.

Students can order food to their room directly from various outlets within campus (canteen, campus hub, brews n bites, fruits from YP shop, etc.).
For reference you may look at apps/websites of Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy.
